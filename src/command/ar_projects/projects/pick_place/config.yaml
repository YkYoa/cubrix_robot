# Pick and Place Motion Sequence
# This project demonstrates a simple pick and place operation

project:

  description: "Pick and place demo with approach/retract motions"
  
  # Motion types used by this project (for documentation/validation)
  # Only these motion types are expected in the sequence
  motion_types:
    - move_joint
    - delay

defaults:
  velocity_scaling: 0.5
  acceleration_scaling: 0.5
  planner:
    pipeline: "pilz"
